### How come did you decide to become a Web Developer, considering your background, age, sex, and location? (LOL).

I'm not another one of those who will tell you "Hey! I'm here for the money". Oh, well, wait.

After working for more than 10 years in the field of language teaching, and having covered a variety of roles in this area, I decided to give myself the chance to start over again. I'll spare you the bit about why I studied languages at university, and left my country, and... 

Flash back to 1995. 

I have always been the geeky one, with a penchant for computers, videogames, and technology. I took up coding for the first time when I was given a (piece-of-trash-by-then) Commodore 128 and a Basic guidebook, and I could not stop staring at the cursor blinking on the screen, trying to use a machine which was already as old as me (other kids played with their dad's 486, but I was out of luck). Then, when I finally got a Pentium and I could put up my first website using Frontpage (yes!) I was so happy. I was 13, I did not even have a mobile phone, but me and my best friend had a webpage full of clipart images and stuff.

Fast forward to 2021.

I had spent more than 10 years in a company where I was one of the only people who knew how to use a computer. I ended up taking care of the online learning platform (Moodle) which was not exactly the most efficient technology to mantain. I ended up designing logos and books because the company would not hire designers. I had to organise and supervise Computer Based examinations, even for free because "pandemic" you know. I had to think out-of-the-box most of the time, in an environment where I could not ask questions about anything because I was (unfortunately) the best one at those things, and was never paid an extra for those skills, because you know "recession".

Hey, did I mention that I teach English? Yes, that was in my last job description. I know how to talk to people in their language and in some others too. I know how to make people understand a language and each other (most of the times). Being a polyglot has changed my way of seeing and living the world, while being an expat made me understand the importance of hard-work, persistance and self-reliance.

And this is just a honest and relatively short summary of my career-wise life story, and yes, I want to land that first job in the field, and so on and so forth. Because I love </> and I deserve "money" too.
